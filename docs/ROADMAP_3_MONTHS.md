## ⚠️ Risk Management

### What If No Clients by Week 8?

**Plan B:**

1. Review proposals - are they generic?
2. Lower rates temporarily (€50-100 projects)
3. Offer free/discounted first project for review
4. Target local businesses (Serbia)
5. Network on LinkedIn

### What If Projects Take Longer?

**Adjust:**

1. Simplify features (MVP first)
2. Skip optional projects (focus on 3 core)
3. Extend timeline by 2-4 weeks
4. Prioritize client work over portfolio

### What If Python Too Hard?

**Support:**

1. AI mentor available 24/7 in VS Code
2. Break tasks into smaller chunks
3. Use more templates/examples
4. Pair programming with AI
5. Focus on one concept at a time
